## Contains:
Number of samples: 2316
Number of SNPs:    8499

## Info:
This is the 25k SNPs in common with the custom 50K NRED Affymetrix chip. 
The alleles has been flipped to match the custom 50K Affy. 
The SNPs has been remapped using BLAST+, to update their positions according to UMD3.1
Some of the animals will have been typed on one of the other chips, but I have removed most
of the animals also genotyped on the custom Affy 50k.
It is best that you check sample overlaps yourself, since we do not have the exact same data.
The IDs are in NorID-format.
