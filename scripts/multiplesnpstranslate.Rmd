**Note**
* The genotype files MUST have the same format
* This script doesn't work on Windows machines. It works on both Linux and Mac OS
* You can generate the .map file using prepare_plink_map_example.Rmd script 

### Remove files format from the file name (if you don't have a format skip this part)

**Example**
In this example i am using a .txt format. You can remove any kind of format from the filename.

```bash
for file in `ls *.txt`
do
newname=`echo $file|sed 's/\.txt$//g'`
mv $file $newname
done
```

### Create a loop in order to run snptranslate for all the files in the directory
Go into the folder where the files are and run the script. 
```bash
#!/bin/bash
#create a variable with the path to the directory where the files are. NOTE: no / at the end of the path
dir='...path/...to/...the/...dir/...containing/...files'
#create another variable  with the patch to the directory where the program snptranslate (and all the dependencies) are.
dir1='...path/...to/...the/...dir/...containing/...program/'

#run the loop
for FILE in "$dir"/*;do
cp ${FILE##*/} ${dir1}
cd ${dir1}
   ./ioSNP.py -i ${FILE##*/} -n FORMAT-OF-THE-FILE -o ${FILE##*/}.ped -u Plink -m marker.map
   rm ${FILE##*/}
cd -
done

```
* The Plink files are located in ${dir1} directory. The name of each file is equal to the original name plus .ped Plink format format.
